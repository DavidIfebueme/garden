/**
 * Back-compat redirect from the retired dock route. The FlexLayout workspace
 * dock was removed in the shell rebuild (2026-09 redesign): surfaces are
 * routed pages now. Old links land on /home; issue deep links (?issue=<id>,
 * e.g. from assignment emails) forward to the task detail route; connector
 * flow links forward to the connections surface.
 *
 * Unauthenticated visitors are sent to /login with the FULL original URL as
 * the post-login redirect — beforeLoad children run before the parent auth
 * loader, so without this check an emailed ?issue= link opened while logged
 * out would lose the issue target.
