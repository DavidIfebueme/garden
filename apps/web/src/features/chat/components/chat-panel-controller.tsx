     *     closed mid-stream, the machine slept — the thread kept a real
     *     conversation in its runtime while its row still looked pristine
     *     forever. The next visit to `/chats` claimed it and rendered that
     *     conversation under the heading "New Chat". Observed 2026-09-18
     *     against thread a34f40b5.
     *   - `agent-interaction-screen.tsx` gates publishing the session to the
     *     router on the same `isPendingFirstTurn` flag, so the hop from
     *     `/chats` to `/chats/<id>` only happened once the reply landed. That
     *     is the "sending from /chats looked like a vanishing send" the route
     *     comment in `chats.index.tsx` describes.
     *
     * After: the row stops looking pristine the moment the turn is dispatched,
     * which closes both. `onFinish` still runs and still overwrites
     * `lastMessage` with the real reply — this only seeds it with what was
     * sent, the same fallback `onFinish` already used when a reply had no text
     * (`buildSessionPreview` → `pending.preview`).
     *
     * Gated on `wasWarm` so later turns keep exactly their old behaviour and
     * do not add a second round trip each.
