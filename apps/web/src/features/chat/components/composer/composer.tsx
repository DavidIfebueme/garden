/**
 * `Composer` — orchestrator for the chat input box.
 *
 * Field type: a plain controlled `<textarea>`, not a rich-text editor.
 *
 * The 2026-09-08 overhaul briefly moved this onto the shared Tiptap
 * `ContentEditor`. The 2026-09-17 review reverted that: bold/italic/headings/
 * alignment have no meaning in a message to a model, and the editor charged
 * for them on every keystroke. Measured against the installed `@tiptap/react`
 * 3.22.4 and `@tiptap/core` 3.22.4, each character typed serialized the whole
 * document to markdown, rebuilt ~20 extension instances (`ContentEditor`
 * builds them inline, and `EditorInstanceManager.onRender` compares them by
 * identity, so the compare always missed), and pushed a full
 * `view.setProps` + `view.updateState` through ProseMirror. The composer is
 * also `key={sessionId}` in the controller, so every session switch tore down
 * and rebuilt an editor, extension manager and view. A textarea costs one
 * store write per keystroke and near-zero mount.
 *
 * The overhaul's other work is kept as-is: the pill, the queued-message slot,
 * the attachment/document chip rows, the `+` and tools menus, and the
 * send/stop/mic footer.
 *
 * `@` and `/` are back on `./member-mention.ts` + `../skill-invocation.ts`
 * cursor detection with `<Command>` popovers. `member-mention.ts` was hardened
 * for this box in July 2026 (4c69e772, f86dc2aa, d3f6d33d, fda427e2:
 * cache-backed lookup, identity preservation, collapsed-deletion rebasing) and
 * the Tiptap pass had deleted it wholesale. Both popovers read live query
 * state on every render, which is also what fixes the cold-load `/` bug the
 * editor's suggestion extension had: it captured the skill list once at
 * creation and never saw the resolved query.
 *
 * `/slug` tokens stay literal text in the committed message (2026-09-08 spec
 * §12); `@` mentions are serialized to mention links at submit.
